            <p>The Corsa has always been a fun, lightweight car.Sure, it doesn't pin you to your seat, but it can still be very engaging to drive, if you do the 
                right mods. The car is very fun through the corners and it just need a little push to become really, really fun.</p>

            <h2 id="per">Performance Upgrades</h2>
            <p>These won't necessarily all be performance upgrades,
                but in general just driving feel enhancements.<br></p>
            <ol style="padding-left:20%;padding-right: 20%;">
                <li class="li">Tires <br><img src="https://gitiusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Champiro-SX2.jpg" alt="tire" width="35%"> <p class="p">In my opinion the most impactful mod you can do is, getting performance tires. The car handles great, the steering wheel is direct and it just
                    makes you throw it into corners like noones business.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Coilovers <br><img src="https://www.ycwsuspension.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/coilovers-1.jpg" alt="coilovers" width="35%"><p class="p">Coilovers are one of the most popular mods out there. And for good reason. If set up right, you get more grip through the corners without
                    sacrificing daily driveability. Plus your car looks extra cool when lowered.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Sport Exhaust <br> <img src="https://cdn.webshopapp.com/shops/258831/files/384294653/image.jpg" alt="exhaust" width="35%"><p class="p">Also a very popular mod, the exhaust upgrade makes maybe the biggest difference in the character of your car. But please, make it sound 
                    at least a little bit tasteful. You know, not like a raspy Honda Civic at 3am. Please.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Short Shifter <br> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2218/5701/products/1500x11_2000x.png?v=1628041379" alt="short shifter" width="35%"><p class="p">Also a huge impact on the drive feel, the short shifter let's you change gears quicker and most of the time just makes them feel better.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Sport Air Filter <br><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61arHNqXwjL._AC_SX355_.jpg" alt="k n filter" width="35%"><p class="p">This one is a bit controversial in some people's eyes, but not in mine. The problem lies that many people think they will get some
                    crazy power with this one mod. Simply not true. What you do get though, is the deeper intake sound, which, in my opinion, is totally worth
                    the $100 they usually cost. </p></li>
                <li class="li">Head Porting <br> <img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-f4487/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/3975/11716/Oval_Port_Head_-_Stock_vs_Ported__79586.1561985769.jpg?c=2?imbypass=on" alt="head porting" width="35%"><p class="p">Now we get to some more serious stuff. Head porting increases compression, and therefore the horsepower. In combination with other mods, 
                    you could get somewhere beetwen 5-15hp more out of the naturally aspirated Corsa.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Valve Polishing <br> <img src="http://forums.pelicanparts.com/uploads15/IMG_0535+Large+1251051599.jpg" alt="polished valves" width="35%"><p class="p">Valve polishing allows the air to just move smoother, since you get rid of the rough edges.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Lightened Flywheel <br> <img src="https://images.cdn.circlesix.co/image/1/640/0/uploads/posts/2017/01/d4bb55adf1305cf769934ccb5428e0a4.jpg" alt="flywheel" width="35%"><p class="p">In my opinion a very important mod for this car in particular, since mine has only 90hp and the factory flywheel feels insanely heavy. 
                    The consequence is that the revs build and fall very slowly, which makes downshifting not as enjoyable as it should be. Getting the flywheel
                    lightened is gonna help with that.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Performance Camshafts <br> <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XO+kV-xOL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="camshaft" width="35%"><p class="p">If you don't mind sacrificing a bit of driveability, put in some performance camshafts. Your car is gonna sound cool as hell, and it's gonna
                    breathe a lot better at higher revs. You could possibly gain even 15hp with this mod.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Remap <br><img src="https://www.autotorque.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ecu-remapping-and-tuning-b3-1080.jpg" alt="remap" width="35%"><p class="p">To make sure the car runs right after all these mods, you need to get it remapped. You could gain up to 10hp with a good remap,but most
                    importantly, you're gonna know your car runs right.</p></li>
                <li class="li">LED Lights <br><img src="https://dsportmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/210-Tech-LEDvsHalogen-003-lightoutput.jpg" alt="led" width="35%"><p class="p">Visual mods are mostly subjective, so do whatever you like. But putting in some Xenon headlights and LED's wherever you can is a good option 
                    in most people's book.</p></li>
